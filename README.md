# Flashcards
> challange project from Codecademy - React - Redux

## Project Goals
In this project, you will practice using **Redux** and **Redux Toolkit** to manage the complex state of a flashcard-style quiz app. 
- Users will be able to create their own topics, 
- quizzes for those topics, 
- and flashcards for those quizzes. 
- Users will also be able to interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

## Prerequisites
- To complete this project, you should have completed **React** and **Redux** courses.


- This app uses `uuidv4()` function from the [`uuid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) package to create unique identifiers for topics/quizzes/cards. Below, you can see an example of how this function is used:

Though not required, if you would like to learn more about this function, check out its [documentation](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-redux/modules/wdcp-22-flashcards/projects/react-redux-flashcards#:~:text=Though%20not%20required%2C%20if%20you%20would%20like%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20this%20function%2C%20check%20out%20its%20documentation).


- This app uses `react-router` to handle routing between different pages. Since `react-router` is outside the scope of this project, we’ve written the routing code for you. Though not required, if you’re curious about how it works, you can explore `App.js` (where the routes for this app are defined), read the `react-router` [docs](https://reactrouter.com/), or take our Learn React Router course!
